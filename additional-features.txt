DONE - Display number of pages betweenthe pagination buttons
DONE - Perform ingredientvalidation in view, before submitting the form - Warn ahead of time if the format is wrong
DONE - Improve recipe ingredient input : separate in multiple fields and allow more than 6 ingredients
DONE - When clearing bookmarks, update icon on current page
Not very insteresting, discarded - Modify icon added to say that the recipe is from a user. Display some text maybe ? Add alt text to icon ?

// Advanced
DONE - Shopping list feature : button that add all of the ingredients of the recipe to a list

Probably done with this project, because I actually want to focus on backend (node.js, express.js, mongodb) So I will leave it like this for now and start learning backend

Weekly meal planning feature : assign recipes to the next 7 days and show on a weekly calendar. 
    - Use drop down to assign recipe to day. If recipe already assigned to day = icon. Overwrite recipe if assigned again ?
    - Create pannel to show all assigned recipes on a weekly calendar
